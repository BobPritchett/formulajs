## Historic

This project is forked from [handsontable/formula.js](https://github.com/handsontable/formula.js) and it's developed for
 everyone needs.
 
Original Formula.js project was developed and maintained by Ismael Chang Ghalimi, with support from STOIC and help from
 the following contributors: Ilmari Karonen, Sébastien Loisel, Trevor Norris, Roönaän, Hannes Stiebitzhofer.

It was then forked and extended by the [handsontable/formula.js](https://github.com/handsontable/formula.js) mainly 
contributed by [@budnix](https://github.com/budnix).

## Contributions and road map 2020

The road map in the coming month is to gather the improvements made in the main forks of the original project. If you 
forked and made changes to sutoiku/formula.js do not hesitate to propose a pull request with your changes. 

To avoid any regression or miss calculation please provide unit tests as long as function improvements.
